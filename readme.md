This program will walk the player through the process of creating a Dungeons and Dragons character, which can be a complicated and lengthy process with a pencil and paper.

The program will act as the character sheet as well as automate the dice rolls for determining stats. The user will be able to freely choose the Class, Race, and other specifics of the character through a guided process. The user will interact with the program and the characters stats will be presented in an easy to read format.

D&D Character Creator, by TWELVE

Description and Motivation
We are TWELVE. This is our D&D Character Creator for D&D 5th Edition (5E). We were dissatisfied with how rigidly-linear other Role Playing Game (RPG) Character Creators are. We imagined a tool that would let the user jump around in the character creation process and experiment with the trade-offs of different options. From the start it was clear to us that we did not know how to do it, or if it could even be done. TWELVE decided to try. We hoped the process of building it would bring us the inspiration we needed, and the world-wide-renown that would justly follow. TWELVE hoped to open up the process in an enjoyable way.

In the end, we were humbled (but undaunted) by the complexity and dependencies of D&D rules. We love what we have created (created on laptops with our very own pizza-greased fingers). Yet TWELVE acknowledges that our creation is very like other RPG-character creators: it is as linear as railroad tracks stretching toward a shimmery, desert horizon. After some experimentation, the logic and dependencies drove us back to the order of the standard process followed in the D&D Player's Handbook (5E). We learned a lot, we had fun working together, we would do it again - and might.

Prior Art
It seems that most of the people who are capable of building a Character Creator have done so. Some have done it more than once. The many we have seen are uniformly linear.

The Flow for the User
Our Character Creator takes the user from the 1st thru the last step in creating a character, and gives them a complete D&D character, ready for play. At each step, the user enters a number corresponding to their choice from the full range of their current options. Like the Player's Handbook, we followed these steps in the following, order:  
● Race: logically comes first since it has no dependencies, and the choice has implications for following steps.
● Name: The user is free to name the character anything. But in D&D there are customary names for every race, subrace or ethnicity.
● Class: The user may choose any one of the 12 standard character classes, which are much like professions - Wizard, Fighter, Cleric, Rogue, etc. This choice echoes through the remaining steps - for the user and for the coders.
● Abilities: 6 core abilities model the physical and psychic potential of each character: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each ability gets a score from 3-18 (3xd6, so it comes from a bell-shaped distribution), and together these scores affect nearly everything that ever happens in the game. We offer 6 scores, each derived by rolling 4 six-sided dice and discarding the lowest score. The user assigns each score to one of the six abilities.
● Background: Everyone is from somewhere, and the user gets to choose from a list of archetypal backgrounds. Each background bestows knowledge and skills, and also carries social implications.
● Skill Proficiencies: There are 18 general skills in D&D (such as stealth, athleticism, medicine, deception) which interact with abilities and class as characters adventure in a treacherous world. Background, Class, and subsequent experience determine which skills characters can master, and to what degree.
● Alignment: Character's morals and values are described in a 2-axis model: the spectrum from Good to Evil, and the spectrum from Chaotic (free-spirited individualists) to Lawful (hierarchy, rules, order). Everyone should choose Chaotic Good (comfort the afflicted, and afflict the comfortable) ... but the user has to choose. It shapes the ends a character will pursue, the means they will employ, and whose company they can endure as they adventure.
● Class Features: These are the various loose ends that get resolved at the final moment of creation - such as hit dice, saving throws, languages, and capabilities tied to the character's chosen class.
